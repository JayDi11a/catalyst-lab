"""OWASP ASI06 — Agent Memory Poisoning attack vectors.

These vectors model real-world prompt injection and memory poisoning
patterns that target agentic AI memory stores. Each vector is a
(content, category, description) tuple.

Categories map to PraxisTypes.poison_patterns fields:
  - instruction_override  → pp.instruction_overrides
  - role_escalation       → pp.role_escalations
  - exfiltration          → pp.exfiltration_markers
  - compound              → triggers multiple categories
  - benign                → safe content that must NOT trigger detection
