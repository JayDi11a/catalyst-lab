(* Surface 5: Multi-agent proof witness transport

   When Agent A persists a fact with a proof certificate and
   Agent B reads it in a different session, B must be able to
   verify A's proof without access to A's private state.

   The proof witness is self-contained: it carries the content
   hash, the rule used, the properties satisfied, and the
   source agent identity. B verifies the witness against the
   stored content — if the hash matches and the witness is
   well-formed, B can trust the fact at the level A proved.

   cf. Gay (OPLSS 2026, Session Types): the agent→persist→read
   protocol is a session type. The proof witness is the message
   payload that must conform to the session protocol.

   cf. TACIT (Odersky et al.): cross-agent proof transport
   parallels their MCP server capability delegation. The proof
   witness is a delegated capability — B receives A's proof
   as a capability to trust the stored fact. *)
