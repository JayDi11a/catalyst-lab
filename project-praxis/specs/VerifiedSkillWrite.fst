(* Surface 2: Verified Skill Persistence (Pulse/separation logic)

   Hermes auto-generates skills every ~15 tool calls and persists
   them to /opt/data/skills/. A generated skill that is unsound
   will compound errors on every future invocation.

   This module composes the Surface 2 verification checks with
   Pulse separation logic for memory safety:
     - skill_interface_valid (contract match)
     - skill_tools_within_scope (capability check)
     - content_safe (OWASP ASI06)
     - persist_bounded (P5 ownership + P7 bounds)

   The postcondition on SkillWriteOk proves all four properties
   hold AND the skill region now contains the verified code body.
   On failure, the region is unchanged (frame rule).

   cf. Li et al. (Dafny as Verification-Aware IL): F* is the
   verification-aware IL for generated skills. The skill spec
   is the contract; only verified code persists.

   Surface 3 (ToolScope) is NOT integrated here: tool_invocation_safe
   operates at call time (needs a tool_result), not at skill
   persistence time. skill_tools_within_scope already checks
   tool scope at the skill level.

   Surfaces 4-5 are read-path verifications (TemporalValidity,
   ProofTransport) — they verify on read, not on write. *)
